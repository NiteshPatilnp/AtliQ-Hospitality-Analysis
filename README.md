## 🧩 Problem Statement  

**AtliQ Grands** is a leading chain of five-star hotels operating across major Indian cities.  
Despite a strong brand presence and 20+ years in the hospitality industry, the company has faced a **decline in market share and revenue** due to increased competition and ineffective management decisions.  

To address these challenges, AtliQ Grands decided to adopt a **Business and Data Intelligence** approach for more informed decision-making.  
Since the company lacked an internal analytics team, they partnered with an external data service provider to derive insights from their historical data.
